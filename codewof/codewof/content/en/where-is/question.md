# Where Is?

Write a program that asks for a region and a country, and prints 
out "{region} is in {country}.". For example, if Canterbury is 
entered as the region, and New Zealand is entered as the country, 
your program would print "Canterbury is in New Zealand." 
(including the full stop after New Zealand).
