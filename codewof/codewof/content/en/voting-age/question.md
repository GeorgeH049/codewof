#Voting Age

Write a program that asks the user for their age and prints out whether 
they are old enough to vote. In this scenario a person who is 18 or older 
is old enough to vote.

If the person is old enough to vote, then print out `You are old enough to vote`.
If the person is not old enough to vote, then print out `You are not old 
enough to vote yet`.
