# Diamond pattern

Write a function `diamond(x)` that takes a positive, odd integer `x` and prints out a diamond (made up of `*` symbols) of size `x`.
For example if we call `diamond(5)` we would expect the output to be:

```
  *
 ***
*****
 ***
  *
```

If `x` is an even number or less than 1 (inclusive), your function should print `That isn't a diamond! Please enter a positive, odd integer.`
