# Sum lucky 7

Create a function `sum_lucky_7(list)` that takes a list of integers and **prints** the sum of the elements in the list.
Except the number 7 is a lucky number, so we double it before adding it to the sum, and the number immediately after a 7 in the list is also doubled (if it is not a 7).

*Note: Your function should return 0 for an empty array.*

For example `sum_lucky_7([6, 13, 1, 7, 4, 2])` should print `44` and `sum_lucky_7([7, 7, 7])` should print `42`.
