# Sum lucky 7

Create a function `sum_lucky_7(list)` that takes a list of integers and **prints** the sum of the elements in the list.
However, the number 7 is a lucky number.
All 7s should be doubled before adding to the sum, and any non-7 numbers immediately after a 7 should also be doubled.

*Note: Your function should return 0 for an empty array.*

For example `sum_lucky_7([6, 13, 1, 7, 4, 2])` should **print** `44` and `sum_lucky_7([7, 7, 7])` should **print** `42`.
