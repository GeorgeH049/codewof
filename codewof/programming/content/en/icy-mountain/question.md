# Icy Mountain

Write a function `number_of_steps(up_amount, down_amount, height)` to return the **number of steps** required to climb a mountain of a specified `height`.
The climber climbs up by `up_amount` per step. 
However, they also slip backwards by `down_amount` per step **if they are not already at the top yet**.
The climber reaches the top when their **current height is greater than or equal to the mountain `height`**.
If the climber will never reach the top, return **False**.
