# Go Tramping?

Write a program that asks the user what temperature it is and prints out whether they should go tramping today.

If the temperature is under 10 degrees, then **print** out `It's too cold!`
If the temperature is 30 degrees or more, then **print** out `It's too hot!`
In all other cases, the temperature is suitable for tramping, so **print** out `Let's go tramping!`
