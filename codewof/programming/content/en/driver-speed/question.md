# Driver speed

Write a function `check_speed(speed)` that checks the speed of drivers. If the speed is less than or equal to 50, it should **print** `Ok.`.
Otherwise, for every 5km above the speed limit (50), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points. If the driver gets more than 5 points the function should print `License suspended.`. 

For example `check_speed(70)` should **print** `4` and `check_speed(53)` should **print** `0`.
