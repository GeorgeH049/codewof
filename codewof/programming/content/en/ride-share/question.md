# Ride Share

Write a function `calculate_ride_share(km, airport_fee)` that calculates a users rideshare fee, then **prints** it out.
The `airport_fee` is either `True` or `False`.

**Details:**

- The rideshare fee is $2.70 per kilometer.
- The airport fee is $6.50.
- All payments need to include GST of 15%.

*Hint: You will need to use the `round()` function. For example, `round(1.11111, 1)` will result in `1.1`.*
