#Pieces of Chocolate

Write a function `pieces_left_over(num_pieces, num_people)` that 
takes the number of pieces of chocolate you have, and the number 
of people the pieces will be shared between, and **returns** the 
number of pieces left over. The chocolate is divided equally 
between people, and there is always more pieces of chocolate 
than people. 

e.g. If I have 8 pieces of chocolate between 5 people, there will 
be 3 pieces of chocolate left over. 

*Hint: The `%` (modulo) operator is useful for this*
