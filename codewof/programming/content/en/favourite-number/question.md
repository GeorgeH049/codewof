# Favourite Number

The following function `is_favourite_number(number)` takes a number as an argument and should **return** `True` if it is 
the number 15 or 22 (someone's favourite numbers), otherwise it should **return** `False`.

Find the bug (or bugs) to fix this function so that it passes all of the tests.
