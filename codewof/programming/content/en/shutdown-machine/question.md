#Shutdown Machine
 
Write a program that repeatedly asks the user for the current temperature of the machine. This machine must shutdown if 
the temperature is 50 or greater, or if it is 0 or less. If the temperature the user has entered is within normal 
operating temperatures, then print `Temperature OK`. If the temperature is too high or low, then your program must stop 
asking for the temperature and should print `Shutting down...`

*Hint: try using a* `while` *loop*
