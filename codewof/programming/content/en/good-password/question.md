#Good Password

Write a program that asks the user for a password in order to check if it meets the requirements for a password. For 
the purposes of this question, a password is good enough if it is at least 5 characters long.

If the password meets the requirements then **print** `Thank you, your password is good enough`, otherwise **print** 
`No, this password is not good enough`. Keep asking the user for a password until they enter one that meets the requirements. 

*Hint: a* `while` *loop is a good type of loop to use when you don't know how many times the loop will run*
