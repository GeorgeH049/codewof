# Pass the parcel

The following function `pass_the_parcel(parcel)` takes a list of strings (each item in the parcel, from inside to out), and should **print** `Person 1 got X!`, where `X` is the *last* item.
The program should continue **printing** `Person n got X!` (where `n` is the nth person to receive something) until the start of the list.
Then it should **print** `The parcel is empty!`

Find the bug (or bugs) to fix this function so that it passes all of the tests.
