# Best Paper, Scissors, Rock

Write a program that plays one round of paper, scissors, rock with a user. It should ask the user whether they would 
like to play paper, scissors, or rock, and then your program should then **print** out what it will play in return. 
Your program should always win, i.e.

- If the user inputs `paper`, then your program should choose `scissors`
- If the user inputs `scissors`, then your program should choose `rock`
- If the user input `rock`, then your program should choose `paper`
