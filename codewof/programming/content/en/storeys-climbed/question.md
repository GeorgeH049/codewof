# Storeys Climbed

Write a program that asks how many mitres were climbed during a tramp and converts this to building storeys.

In this scenario each building storey is 4 mitres tall. We only want to include whole floors (round down to the closest whole number). 

*Hint: The `//` (floor operator) will round down to the closest whole number.*
