# Ticket Calculator

The following function `get_ticket_price(age)` takes an age and **returns** the ticket cost for a person of that age.

Ticket prices are:

- Free for people 5 years old and younger.
- $10 for people 12 years old and younger.
- $16 for everyone older than 12 years old.

The function works for most cases but there are problems with it.
Find the bug (or bugs) to fix the function.
