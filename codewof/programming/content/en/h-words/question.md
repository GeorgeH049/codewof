#H words

Write a program that repeatedly asks the user for words that start with H (capital or lowercase). Each time it gets a word that starts with H, it should **print** `Yes, {given word} starts with H.` and prompt the user for another H word. Your program should keep asking the user for H words until the user gives it a word that doesn't start with H. Then your program should **print** `No, {given word} doesn't start with H!` and stop.

*Hints: A `while` loop is a good type of loop to use when you don't know how many times the loop will run. The string methods `str.startswith()` and `str.lower()` may also be helpful.*
