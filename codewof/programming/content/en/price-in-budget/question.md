# Price in Budget

The following function `is_price_in_budget(price)` that takes the price of a mobile phone as an argument and should 
**return** `True` if the price is between $100 and $500 (inclusive), otherwise it should **return** `False`.

Find the bug (or bugs) to fix the function so that it passes all of the tests.
