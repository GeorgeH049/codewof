# Space Cargo Management

Make a function `eject_cargo(cargo, hull_capacity)` that ejects cargo until your spaceship is no longer overburdened.

It should pop items from the end of `cargo` and then print `'Ejected {item}''`

**returns**

that takes `cargo`, a Python list of strings representing items stored in the hull of your spaceship and an integer `hull_capacity`, how much space you have on board.
