# Acceleration Calculator
The following function `acceleration(velocity_initial, velocity_final, time)` takes the initial and final velocity of an object (m/s) and the time (s), and should return the correct acceleration (m/s<sup>2</sup>).

This function looks like it should work, but there are problems with it. Find the bug (or bugs) to fix the function.
