# Inside 25 to 50

The following function `inside_25_to_50(number, outside_mode)` takes a number `number` and a boolean `outside_mode` as arguments.
The function should **return** `True` if the number is in the range 25 to 50 (inclusive) and `outside_mode` is `False`, otherwise it should return `False`.
If `outside_mode` is `True`, the function should **return** `True` if the number is less than 25 or greater than 50. Otherwise it should return `False`.

Find the bug (or bugs) to fix this function so that it passes all of the tests.
