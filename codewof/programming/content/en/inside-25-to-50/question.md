# Inside or outside 25-50

The following function `inside_or_outside(number, is_inside)` takes a number `number` and a boolean `is_inside` as arguments.

If `is_inside` is `True` then:

- The function should **return** `True` if `number` is in the range 25 to 50 (inclusive)
- The function should **return** `False` if `number` is less than 25 or greater than 50

If `is_inside` is `False` then:

- The function should **return** `False` if `number` is in the range 25 to 50 (inclusive)
- The function should **return** `True` if `number` is less than 25 or greater than 50

Find the bug (or bugs) to fix this function so that it passes all of the tests.
