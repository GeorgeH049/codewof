# Print Pet

Write a function `print_pet(name, age, species)` that takes as arguments:

  - `name` - a string containing a pet's name
  - `age` - an integer representing a pet's age
  - `species` - a string containing the species of pet it is, e.g. dog or cat.

 Your function should **print** a string in the format: `{name} is a {age}-year-old {species}.` (including the full-stop).

 *Hint: the `str` function might be useful, e.g. `str(2)` is "2"*
