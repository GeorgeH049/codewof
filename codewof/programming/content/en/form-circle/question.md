# Form Circle

A class is outside in a line to play duck duck goose. They must make a circle in order to start.

Write a function `form_circle(students)` that takes a list of students, `students`, and **prints** `{first student} and {last student} should sit next to each to make a circle.`

If there is only one student they should sit next to themselves. Your function will not be tested with 0 students.
