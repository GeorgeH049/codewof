#Quadratic Formula

Write a function `get_roots(a, b, c)` that takes the `a`, `b`, and `c` coefficients of a quadratic equation and returns the roots.
Roots should be floats, limited to 2 decimal points.


If there are two real roots, then return them as a **tuple** where the higher root is first. 
If there is only one real root, then return it as a **single value**.
If there are no real roots, then return **None**.

*Hint: `sqrt` from the math module (`from math import sqrt`) and `round` will be useful.*
