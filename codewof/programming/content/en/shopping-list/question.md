#Shopping List

Write a function `print_shopping_list(shopping_list)` that takes a list `shopping_list` and prints each item on a new 
line with a checkbox `[]` made of square brackets in front of it. For example, calling 
`print_shopping_list(['Spinach', 'Chickpeas'])` should print:
```
[] Spinach
[] Chickpeas
```
