# Eight is great

Create a function `eight_is_great(a, b)` that takes two integers, a and b, and **returns** `True` if either one is 8 or if their sum or difference is 8.
Otherwise it should **return** `False`.

For example `eight_is_great(15, 7)` **returns** `True` because the difference between 15 and 7 is 8.
