# Favourite food

Write a program that **prints** `What is your favourite food?` and takes an input from the user.
The program should then **print** `Yummm... {x}` where `{x}` is the string the user typed in.

For example if the user types in `cupcakes` then your program should **print** `Yummm... cupcakes`.
