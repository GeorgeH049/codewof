# Rollercoaster ride

Write a function `ride_the_rollercoaster(age, with_an_adult)` that takes a number and a boolean value (i.e. `True` or ` False`)
and **prints** a message saying whether you can ride the rollercoaster.

A person cannot ride the rollercoaster if they are:

- 5 years or younger, or
- younger than 12 and not accompanied by an adult.

They can ride the rollercoaster if they are:

- 12 years or older, or
- between 6 and 11, and also accompanied by an adult.

If the person can ride the rollercoaster then the function should **print**
"You can ride the rollercoaster".
If they cannot ride the rollercoaster then the function should **print**
"Sorry, you cannot ride the rollercoaster".
