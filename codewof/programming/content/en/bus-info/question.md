#Bus Info

Write a function `bus_info(bus_id, minutes_away)` that takes as arguments:
 - The `bus_id` - a string containing the identifier of the bus service, 
 e.g. 13A.
 - `minutes_away` - an integer representing the number of minutes until the 
 bus arrives.
 
Your function should **return** a string in the format: `Service {bus_id} 
is due in {minutes_away} minutes time.` (including the full-stop).

*Hint: the `str` function might be useful, e.g. `str(42)` is "42"*
